		<p>
			To modify anything, you first need to be logged in. In order to do so go to btdanceproject.com/wp-admin
		</p>



		<p> When modifying things like a page, a post, a portfolio item, you'll be able to either preview or update it. We advice to
			always preview it before publishing, because you can always leave the page without saving when you don't want to keep
			your changes. When you update it, it's saved and live. </p>

		<p></p>To add pictures and movies : it's necessary to upload them. In the dashboard, select "Medias" and "Add news".
		In a second time, click on "Select files" and select your medias on your pc and "open". The file will load automatically.</p>
		<img src="images/addMedias.png" alt="#">


		<h2 id="home">Home :</h2>
		<p> Slider : You can change the images.</p>
		<p>Breaking news : You can change the text and if there's a button with a link or not. </p>
		<p>Performance Works: Automatically display the most recent project.</p>
		<p>to make a project <strong>the most recent</strong> you have to change the date of the project <a href="#project">(portfolio item)</a> by editing his date on the right window named 'Publish'.<br>click on edit then ok then update.

		<h3 id="slider">Modifying The Slider </h3>

		<p>
			First, you need to be on your Home page and logged in. In the Wordpress command bar, go in Slider Revolution -> Home Slider.
			<img src="images/modify_slider.png" alt="">
		</p>

		<p>
			You land on a page where these are your slides :
			<img src="images/slider_slides.png" alt="">
		</p>


		<p>Click on the picture of the slide you want to modify.
		</p>

		<p>In the menu under it you have your main image :

		</p>

		<p> Click on "Media library" and either select your picture that's in the wordpress library or upload files.
		</p>

		<p> You need to save for each slide you modify, the button is in the top right corner.
		</p>

			Builder this are your news :
			<img src="images/news_home.png" alt="">
			<br />Click on the edit button on the one you want to modify and change it's content.
		</p>
		<h5>If you want to add or delete a button :</h5>

		<p>
			A button needs three fields : a Read More text, Read More Link, and a button style. Simply fill them or empty them if you
			want or not a button.
			<br> The Read more Text is always "READ MORE" and the button style is always : " {"style":"style-hallowred","padding":"padding-small","rounded":""}
			".
		</p>

		<h2 id="about"> About</h2>
		<p> To modify either the text of the picture, on the about page click on + Edit page. In WPBakery Page Builder, Edit the block

			picture to replace it(the red arrow on the picture) You can modify the text, then save.</p>

		<img src="images/press_ex.png" alt="">
		<p> You can drag and drop it if you want you move it, but make sure to respect the same structure. It's safer not to move them,
			and so to duplicate one just below the place you want to add a new one.

		</p>

			as the previous one. Then save your item, preview your page, and save it.
